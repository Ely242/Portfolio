                        <p>
                            I have been playing chess for about three years now. I started really getting into the game during my senior year in high school and I have been playing it consistently ever since. Additionally, during my senior year in high school, I and some of my friends started to lead the chess club at our school.  In the chess club, we would play friendly matches against each other and sometimes represent our school in nationwide chess tournaments. Fortunately, I was able to participate in one of these tournaments despite only just starting to play it seriously that year. During that tournament, I ended up winning all five of my games and earned a trophy for the top player in my section.

                        <p>
                            I was very proud of this accomplishment and it was a great way to end my high school chess career. Moreover, our school's team's performance in the tournament was so good that our school was called the top chess school in The Bahamas in 2023. Even to this day, I continue to play chess and improve my skills. I attend my university's chess club and although there are many players better than myself, I love to learn from them and improve my game.

                            During my last year in high school, I got the opportunity to participate in the annual Build-A-Bridge competition. This competition is where high school students from all over The Bahamas come together to build a bridge out of popsicle sticks and glue. The bridge is then tested to see how much weight it can hold before breaking. The competition is a great way to get students interested in engineering and to give them a taste of what it is like to be an engineer. I was very excited to participate in this competition because I have always been interested in engineering and I wanted to see if I could build a bridge that could hold the most weight.

                        <p>
                            I ended up building a bridge that held 231 pounds before breaking. This was the second-highest weight held in the competition and I was very proud of my team's accomplishment. I was also very happy because it was the highest Queen's College had ever gotten in the competition. I am sure that the next team will do even better and I hope that they can win the competition.

                        <p>
                            I first started to learn about programming during a summer camp several years ago. At the time, I did not have the same passion I have for programming that I do now. However, I did find it interesting and I wanted to learn more about it I think that this is also when I decided that I wanted a career in the tech industry. This led me to choose to major in Software Engineering at university in order to pursue this goal of mine. Ever since the start of my first year, I have been learning more and more about programming and I have been enjoying it. I have learned several programming languages such as Javascript, Python, and C and I will be continuing to learn even more to expand my skills.

                        <p>
                            I am really excited for my future software engineering courses such as data structures and object-oriented programming. I have also learned about software development and how to work in a team to develop software to solve problems. I will continue to improve and develop myself so that I will be an outstanding professional software designer. I wish to work on many projects that have real-world impacts on people. I have learned so much about programming and I am excited to learn even more in the future.
