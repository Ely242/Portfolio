                        <p>
                            I spent my entire high school career at Queen's College Nassau Bahamas, and was a part of the graduating class of 2023. During my time at Queen's College, I was able to participate in many clubs such as the computer club, chess club, animal justice league, and the build-a-bridge team. Queen's College did an outstanding job at preparing me for my future in university and I am very grateful for the time I spent there. I was able to make many friends and memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life. My teachers always pushed me to do my best and I would not be where I am today without their guidance and support. They pushed me to never settle for less than my best and to always strive for excellence. I had teachers who believed in me and would pull me to the side if they saw that I was slipping up. Going to school felt like I was going to see my second family every day. We would laugh, learn, and grow together. My friends were also outstanding students which encouraged me to always keep up with my work and to never fall behind. QC prepared me for my national exams (BGCSEs) and despite taking seven of them a year early, I was able to get an A grade in each of them and also another two A grades the following year in grade 12.

                        <p>
                            This also led me to start and complete four Advanced Placement (AP) courses in my senior year and get two 5s, a 4 and a 3 on the exams. These accomplishments were beneficial because they helped me to get into the university of my choice and also get a scholarship to help pay for my tuition. I am very grateful for the time I spent at Queen's College and I will always be a proud QC Comet. We would laugh, learn, and grow together.

                            One of my major accomplishments and the one that I am most proud of is being one of the recipients of The Bahamas National Merit scholarship. This scholarship is the second-highest scholarship in The Bahamas under the All Bahamas Merit and is rewarded top students in the country annually. Going to university has always been one of my goals and I knew I would need the financial help from scholarships to be able to afford it. I worked very hard in high school to get good grades and to be involved in many extracurricular activities to make myself a well-rounded student. The criteria for the scholarship were rigorous and I knew I had to work hard to be able to stand out. Students had to have a minimum of a 3.50 GPA, at least a score of 1220 on the SAT exams, 7 As in BGCSEs, and be involved in many extracurricular activities.

                            <br><br>
                            Students also had to go through an interview process and be able to show themselves to a team of around eight judges. I was very nervous during the interview but I managed to get through it and was very happy when I found out that I was one of the recipients of the scholarship. I was offered a $20,000 scholarship that is awarded annually. This scholarship is a true testament to the hard work and dedication that I put into my studies during my time in high school. Not only that, but it also gave me the chance to meet other outstanding students from around the country and to be able to network with them. I am proud of all of us and I can guarantee that we will all go on to do great things in the future.

                    <p>
                        The University of Guelph was the first university to catch my eye when I was applying to universities during my senior year in high school. A representative from the school came to my high school and told us all about the university and the food especially. I had not fully thought of what I wanted to do for university or study at that time but that was the foot-in-the-door for me. I knew I wanted to study something technology-related whether it was computer engineering, computer science, or software engineering. I applied to several universities in Canada and started getting acceptance letters around February of 2023. However, the universities that were accepting me did not spark my interest as much as Guelph did. Fortunately, before I made the final decision for which university I would attend, I had gotten accepted to the University of Guelph, and I knew immediately that this would be the university for me. I was very excited to start my journey at Guelph and to be able to study something that I was passionate about.

                    <p>
                        I was also very excited to be able to meet new people and to be able to experience a new culture. Presently, I am in my first year at the University of Guelph and studying Software Engineering. I have a passion for computers and tech and I am thrilled to learn more about the field. The courses here are very interesting and I am always learning new things that will eventually be beneficial to me in the future. I am also a part of the Guelph Caribbean Student Association and I am very excited to be able to meet other students from the Caribbean and to be able to share our experiences with each other. I am very excited for my future at the University of Guelph and I am looking forward to the many opportunities that will come my way.
